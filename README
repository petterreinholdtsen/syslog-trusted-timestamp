Syslog trusted timestamp
========================

A system to fetch a trusted timestamp from a trusted timestamp service
and syslog the result.  This is particularly useful when syslogging
the timestamp of the previous syslog files every time the log files
are rotated, providing a chain of trusted timestamp that allow log
tampering to be discovered.

Wikipedia got more information about Trusted timestamping and Linked
timestamping on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_timestamping .  I recommend you read
those pages.

Thre are several trusted timestamping services available, both free
and commercially available.  Two such free services are available from:
