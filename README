Syslog trusted timestamp
========================

A system to fetch a trusted timestamp from a trusted timestamp service
and syslog the result.  This is particularly useful when syslogging
the timestamp of the previous syslog files every time the log files
are rotated, providing a chain of trusted timestamp that allow log
tampering to be discovered.
